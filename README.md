# CS255

Our client was DriveerPass. They wanted us to design a system that would give customers the ability to take practice tests for a driver's education course, as well as set up appointments for an in-person driving test before they went to the DMV for the real tests.

I felt that I did a good job in designing the various system diagrams, as well as using common terminology for a less-technically oriented listener.

Although I felt that I did well in creating the diagrams, I feel that I could definitely improve on them. I feel that some should be more detailed than what they are.

By reading the needs of the user, I was able to implement them into the system by making sure they are built within the design of the system. It is important to consider the needs of the user because they are the ones this system is being built for.

Designing software can be made easier by approaching it in a modular design. Using object oriented techniques, code can be easily manipulated for the changing needs of the software. I would continue to use an object oriented approach when designing future systems.
